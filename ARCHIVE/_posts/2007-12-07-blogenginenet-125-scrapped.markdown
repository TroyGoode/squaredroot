Apparently this just isn't my day when it comes to project released that I've been looking forward to. [Mads Kristensen](http://blog.madskristensen.dk/) posted to the [BlogEngine.net project's website](http://dotnetblogengine.net/) stating that [the 1.2.5 release of the project (a service pack, really) will no longer happen](http://dotnetblogengine.net/post/Release-news.aspx) and that all of its changes will be rolled into a 1.3 release, due before the end of the year. 

Disappointing, yes, but really for the best. The 1.2.5 release fixed quite a few bugs, but none of them show stoppers (well, for me) and 1.3 looks to add some new features to the equation. 

## Coming in 1.3: 

* Full mono support (right out of the box)
* Updated Meta-Weblog API including support for creating/editing pages in WLW
* Improved Blog importer/exporter, including support for easily switching between XML and SQL backends 
* New extension manager to managing extensions and their settings
* New events for extension writers
* Support for mobile devices
* New themes

I'm especially looking forward to the mobile device support and further Live Writer integration.
