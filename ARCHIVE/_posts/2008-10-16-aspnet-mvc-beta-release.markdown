I discovered via [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/aspnet/ASP_net_MVC_goes_Beta) this afternoon that the ASP.Net MVC framework's beta release is now [available for download from Microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a24d1e00-cd35-4f66-baa0-2362bdde0766&displaylang=en&tm). No release or source code is yet available from the [CodePlex project](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet), but I expect we'll see it there soon enough. Congratulations to the team at Microsoft, RTM is knocking at the door!
