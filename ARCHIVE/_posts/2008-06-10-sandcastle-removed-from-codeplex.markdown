[Sandcastle](http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6174811.html) - the .Net community equivalent of [RDoc](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/)/[JavaDoc](http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/) and the spiritual successor of the now defunct [NDoc](http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/) &ndash; [has been removed from CodePlex](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2008/06/06/sandcastle-project-removed-from-codeplex.aspx). It's fate is currently up in the air and Microsoft is asking you for input on what should happen next. It was pulled down after the community at-large expressed reservations about Sandcastle being hosted on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com) while not being published under an Open Source license or even being posted in source form at all. According to the announcement on MSDN, the possible future for Sandcastle involves two scenarios: 

* Publish the source code for Sandcastle and revive this project in Codeplex
* Migrate sandcastle to MSDN Code gallery at [http://code.msdn.microsoft.com](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/)

I for one would love to see Sandcastle released as an open source project on CodePlex. It seems to me that Microsoft has had a great deal of success lately with releasing the MVC Framework as an open source project and I hope that they continue the trend. If you have used Sandcastle or foresee the need to have automatic code documentation generation on a project in the future, please do not hesitate to [leave a comment](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2008/06/06/sandcastle-project-removed-from-codeplex.aspx) letting the powers that be know how you feel.
