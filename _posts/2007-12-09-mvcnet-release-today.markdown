Hi Panjkov,

>>>>>> is this correct link for asp.net extensions preview that will be shipped (today?) go.microsoft.com/fwlink (taken from www.hunterstrat.com/.../microsoft-releases-adonet-entity-framework-aspnet-35-extensions-previews )

Thanks,

Scott

**Update:** As everyone is aware by now, I'm sure, the MVC Framework has been released. You can [get it here](http://asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/).
