I know, I know... I haven't been blogging much recently, but don't think that you've gotten rid of me yet. My fianc&egrave; and I have been very busy preparing for our wedding, which after nearly a year of planning is now only days away [obligatory Office paraphrase: Mr. Troy Goode... Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?]. On Monday Alexandra and I will be leaving for the [Sandals Grande St. Lucian](http://www.sandals.com/main/grande/gl-home.cfm) for two weeks of sun, sailing, and relaxing. There are still a couple things in the cooker that I'll be working on after I get back, so hopefully you'll be hearing more about that toward the end of June. Wish me luck! 

## Visual Studio / ReSharper Settings

I've been meaning to post my Visual Studio & ReSharper settings for a while, primarily so I have one central place to download the settings from when I set up a new machine at home or work. Feel free to ignore the files I've posted below, or try them out to see my modified dark color scheme!
